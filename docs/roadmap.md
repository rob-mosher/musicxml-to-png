# Roadmap

This document outlines planned features and improvements for musicxml-to-png.

## Near-term

- Additional ensemble types (jazz combo, chamber, wind ensemble)
- Articulation markers
- Observability: add structured logging/verbosity controls when the surface area grows; keep simple stderr notes until then.
- Connection UX polish:
  - presets for curvature/alpha and refined default gap handling
  - curved/straight toggle in CLI and library presets
  - SVG export option for vector-friendly connections/lines
  - connection trimming/z-order so lines sit behind notebars without losing continuity

## Long-term vision

- AI systems that natively "speak" MusicXML - the ultimate goal
- Animation showing temporal unfolding
- Integration with compositional AI tools
- Configurable color schemes and visual styles
- Integration with apps to display music visually
